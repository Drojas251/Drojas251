I am a Robotics enthusiast with a passion for autonomous systems. I am currently a masters student at UC Davis working on robotic systems for missions of deep space exploration. In additon, I am an entrepreneur in the process of developing software applications for a variety of industries. More work updates on that soon to come! 

I love making new connections and learning from others, so feel free to reach out!
